# How Users Read on the Web
http://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-users-read-on-the-web/
* Summary: They don't. People rarely read Web pages word by word; instead, they scan the page, picking out individual words and sentences.
* As a result, Web pages have to employ scannable text, using
* highlighted keywords (hypertext links serve as one form of highlighting; typeface variations and color are others)
* meaningful sub-headings (not "clever" ones)
* bulleted lists
* one idea per paragraph (users will skip over any additional ideas if they are not caught by the first few words in the paragraph)
* the inverted pyramid style, starting with the conclusion
* half the word count (or less) than conventional writing
