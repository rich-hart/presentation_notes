* Just like quick-and-dirty coding decisions can lead to technical debt, poor documentation can lead to operational debt.
* The repercussions of sloppy documentation are twofold: some fraction of developers who would otherwise have used your product won't use it,
* and those that do will require more attention from your support team.

## Users are busy
* Though it is a great book, your goal is to produce a PDF with your homework properly formatted, not to read a novel.
* The vast majority of people who visit your documentation are there not to learn more about your fascinating product. 
* You can't expect that users will actually read any of your documentation.
