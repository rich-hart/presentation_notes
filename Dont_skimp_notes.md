# Don't Skimp on Documentation

* Just like quick-and-dirty coding decisions can lead to technical debt, poor documentation can lead to operational debt.
* The repercussions of sloppy documentation are twofold: some fraction of developers who would otherwise have used your product won't use it,
* and those that do will require more attention from your support team.

## Users are busy
* Though it is a great book, your goal is to produce a PDF with your homework properly formatted, not to read a novel.
* The vast majority of people who visit your documentation are there not to learn more about your fascinating product. 
* You can't expect that users will actually read any of your documentation. <--
* Many users will try to copy and paste the exact contents of a code box into a text file or command prompt and expect it to run, without reading any of the surrounding comments.
*  You cannot assume your users have any context besides what you put in a code sample and maybe one or two sentences above or below. 

## Users are coming from Google
* Over 50% of the visitors to Twilio's documentation come straight from Google, and your documentation probably has a similarly high number. This has several interesting implications.
* First, you need to think about SEO for everything that you write. Specifically, you should make sure that:

* Writing effective documention requires you to understand who your user is, how they behave and how they are finding answers to their questions. You also need to dedicate time in your product development cycle to writing documentation good enough so that users can figure out your product.

## You are busy
* That's why you should write your documentation first, before you start coding. This means you're doing it while you're still really excited about the project.
* It also forces you to think through some of the decisions you will make, before you start writing code for things that you're not going to implement.
* Writing the documentation first will also help you program to an interface, not to an implementation.
